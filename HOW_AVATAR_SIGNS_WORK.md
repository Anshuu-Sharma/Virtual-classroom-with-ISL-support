# How Avatar Signing Works

## 🎭 Current System: Pre-defined Signs (NOT ML-based)

The avatar signs you're seeing are **NOT based on a machine learning model**. Here's how it actually works:

### Current Flow:

1. **Whisper** → Transcribes your speech to text ✅ (ML-based)
2. **Stanford Parser** → Translates English to ISL word order (Rule-based, NOT ML)
3. **Lookup Table** → Maps words to SiGML animation files (Pre-defined)
4. **Avatar** → Plays pre-recorded sign animations

## 📋 How It Works:

### Step 1: Translation (Rule-Based)
- Uses **Stanford Parser** (Java-based NLP tool)
- Reorders English grammar to ISL grammar (SOV order)
- Removes stop words, lemmatizes
- **This is NOT ML-based** - it's rule-based parsing

### Step 2: Sign Lookup (Pre-defined Library)
- System looks up each word in `sigmlFiles.json`
- Contains **848+ pre-defined SiGML files**
- Each word maps to a specific animation file:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "hello",
    "fileName": "hello.sigml"
  }
  ```

### Step 3: Animation Playback
- If word found → plays that sign's animation
- If word NOT found → spells it letter by letter
- Avatar plays signs sequentially

## 📁 What You Have:

- **848+ SiGML files** in `SignFiles/` directory
- Each file contains animation data for one sign
- Pre-created by linguists/sign language experts
- **NOT generated by ML models**

## 🚀 ML Model Status:

### What We Built (But NOT Using Yet):
- **LSTM Seq2Seq Translation Model** - Trained to translate English→ISL
- **Training Pipeline** - Ready for Kaggle
- **Evaluation Metrics** - Ready to measure quality

### What's Actually Running:
- **Whisper ASR** ✅ (ML-based, working)
- **Stanford Parser** (Rule-based, old system)
- **Pre-defined Signs** (Lookup table, not ML)

## 🔄 To Use ML Model Instead:

Currently, the system uses:
```
English Text → Stanford Parser → ISL Words → Lookup Table → SiGML Files → Avatar
```

To use the ML model:
```
English Text → LSTM Model → ISL Words → Lookup Table → SiGML Files → Avatar
```

**The ML model is ready, but not integrated yet!** We'd need to:
1. Train the model on Kaggle
2. Replace Stanford Parser with ML model in `server.py`
3. Load the trained model

## 📊 Summary:

| Component | Type | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Whisper ASR** | ML Model | ✅ Working |
| **Translation** | Rule-based (Stanford Parser) | ✅ Working (old) |
| **LSTM Translation** | ML Model | ⚠️ Ready but not used |
| **Avatar Signs** | Pre-defined SiGML files | ✅ Working (848+ signs) |
| **Sign Generation** | NOT ML - Pre-recorded | ✅ Working |

## 🎯 So the Answer is:

**No, the avatar signs are NOT based on a model.** They're:
- Pre-created SiGML animation files
- Mapped via a lookup table (`sigmlFiles.json`)
- Played sequentially by the avatar

**The ML model we built** is for **translation** (English→ISL), not for generating new signs. The signs themselves are pre-recorded animations.

Want to integrate the ML translation model? We can do that! 🚀
